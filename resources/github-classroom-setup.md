# Glossary

- **Git**: A version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project. It is a distributed version control system, meaning the entire codebase and its history are available on every developer's computer.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on software development projects.
- **GitHub Classroom**: A tool that allows teachers to create and manage assignments using GitHub repositories. It allows teachers to create student repositories, distribute starter code, collect assignments, and provide feedback to students.
- **Repository**: A repository is a storage location where your project's files are stored. It can be local to a directory on your computer or a storage location on GitHub.
- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It is a record of what changes you have made to your repository.
- **README**: A README file is a text file that contains information about your project. It is usually the first file people see when visiting your repository on GitHub.
- **.gitignore**: A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in your project. It is useful for excluding files generated by your development environment, such as log files, build artifacts and temporary files.
